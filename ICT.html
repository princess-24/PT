        <h1>The Man Who Can't Be Moved</h1>
        <h3>By: The Script</h3>
        <p>Going back to the corner where I first saw you<br>
        Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move<br>
        Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand<br>
        Saying, "If you see this girl, can you tell her where I am?"</p>
        <p>Some try to hand me money, they don't understand<br>
        I'm not broke, I'm just a broken-hearted man<br>
        I know it makes no sense, what else can I do?<br>
        And how can I move on when I'm still in love with you?</p>
        <p> <i> Refrain</i></p>
       <p> 'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me<br>
        And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be<br>
        Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet<br>
        And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street</p>
       <p> <i> Chorus</i> </p>
         <p class="chorus">So I'm not moving, I'm not moving<br>
        I'm not moving, I'm not moving</p>
       <p><i> Verse</p></i>
        <p>Policeman says, "Son, you can't stay here"<br>
        I said, "There's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year<br>
        Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows<br>
        If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go"</p>
         <p> <i> Refrain</i></p>
       <p>'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me<br>
        And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be<br>
        Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet<br>
        And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street</p>
          
       <p class="chorus">So I'm not moving, I'm not moving<br>
        I'm not moving, I'm not moving</p>
       <p> <i>Bridge</i></p>
        <p>People talk about the guy that's waiting on a girl, oh...<br>
            There are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world, hmm<br>
            And maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved<br>
            And maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news<br>
            And you'll come running to the corner<br>
            'Cause you'll know it's just for you<br>
            I'm the man who can't be moved<br>
            I'm the man who can't be moved</p>
         <p> <i> Refrain</i></p>
        <p>'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me<br>
            And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be<br>
            Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet<br>
            And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street</p>
       <p> <i> Last Refrain</i></p>
      <p>'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me<br>
            And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be<br>
            Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet<br>
            And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street</p>  
         <p>Going back to the corner where I first saw you<br>
            Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move</p>
